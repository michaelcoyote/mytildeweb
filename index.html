<p>There are many like it, but this one is mine!</p>

<p>
Who am I?</p>
<p>
I'm just a guy. If you passed me on the street you probably wouldn't even notice. That used to bother me a bit, but now I'm ok with that.</p>
<p>
I used to live in Columbus, Ohio for many years, but now I live in sunny Northern California where I live with my wife.  I try to think happy thoughts most of the time, but the world can be a sad place, so it's good I have someone I can hug everyday.</p>
<p>
I post to twitter as <a href="https://twitter.com/michaelcoyote" target="_blank">michaelcoyote</a> and I sometimes use <a href="http://github.com/michaelcoyote" target="_blank">GitHub</a> for my weird projects and <a href="https://gist.github.com/michaelcoyote" target="_blank">unrealized schemes</a> </p>
